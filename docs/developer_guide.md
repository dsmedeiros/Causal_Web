# Developer Guide

This project follows the Single Responsibility Principle and decomposes complex tasks into small modules. The event/PQ kernel described in [theory.md](../theory.md) ยง11 is the canonical execution model.

Notable modules:

- `engine/engine_v2/adapter.py`
- `engine/engine_v2/scheduler.py`
- `engine/engine_v2/lccm/`
- `engine/engine_v2/rho_delay.py`
- `engine/engine_v2/epairs.py`
- `engine/stream/server.py`
- `ui_new/ipc/Client.py`
- `ui_new/graph/GraphView.py`
- `experiments/runner.py`
- `experiments/ga.py`
- `experiments/artifacts.py`
- etc.

## Dev loop

```bash
pre-commit install
ruff . && black . && mypy .
pytest -q
cw run --no-gui
cw run
```

## Ray Cluster

Distributed execution uses a lightweight wrapper around [Ray](https://www.ray.io). A cluster can be configured programmatically via `ray_cluster.init_cluster()` or from the CLI using `--ray-init`:

```bash
python -m Causal_Web.main --ray-init '{"num_cpus":4}'
```

The JSON payload is forwarded directly to `ray.init` allowing resource limits or addresses to be specified.

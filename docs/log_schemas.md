# Canonical Log Schemas

This document describes two generalized schemas used across Causal_Web log files.

## Diagnostic Per-Tick Schema

Diagnostic logs capture granular tick flow, emission decisions and failures. Despite varying payloads they all share a common wrapper generated by `GenericLogEntry`.

```
log_id: str            # unique entry id
tick: int              # simulation tick
timestamp: datetime    # creation time in UTC
correlation_id: str?   # optional grouping identifier
event_type: str        # name of the log file or event
payload: object        # log specific fields
```

Fields within `payload` differ per file (e.g. `node`, `phase`, `source`, `target`,
`reason`, `coherence`). Any information not covered by the common fields should
be stored inside this metadata object. Example entries:

```json
{
  "log_id": "log_1",
  "tick": 42,
  "timestamp": "2024-05-01T12:00:00Z",
  "event_type": "tick_emission_log",
  "payload": {"node_id": "n1", "tick_time": 42, "phase": 1.57}
}
```

## Event-Driven/Periodic Schema

Summary and phenomenon logs record higher level events or periodic metrics. They
follow a lighter structure:

```
tick: int?             # tick associated with the record when relevant
label: str             # short identifier of the event or metric
value: object          # measurement, list or mapping
metadata: object?      # optional additional context
```

`tick` is omitted for pure summaries like `manifest.json`. `label` might refer to
a node, region or metric name. `value` contains the main data such as counts,
state maps or diagnostics. Extra fields (e.g. `origin`, `affected_nodes` or
`confidence`) reside under `metadata`.

These schemas unify log processing by distinguishing fine-grained diagnostic
records from coarser periodic summaries.

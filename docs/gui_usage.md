# GUI Usage

## Modes
Edit mode allows graph editing. Switching to **Run** compiles the current graph into a deterministic `GraphDTO` and locks further edits.

## Panels
The right-hand dock hosts:
- **Telemetry**
- **Meters**
- **DOE**
- **GA**
- **Replay**
- **Compare**

## Replay
Select a run from the DOE or GA tables to open a replay. Select two rows and press **Compare** to view synchronized playback and metric deltas side by side.
